## About Me

I’m an Electrical and Computer Engineering student and a hands-on software developer with a strong interest in building real-world solutions.

My work sits at the intersection of **software engineering, system design, and product thinking**. I enjoy taking ideas from zero to something people can actually use — whether that’s a mobile app, a web platform, or an internal tool.

- Currently focused on backend development and Go, with an emphasis on performance and clean architecture  
- Experienced in cross-platform mobile development and modern web stacks  
- Actively building projects and contributing to a digital services startup  
- Interested in long-term product building, startups, and scalable systems
